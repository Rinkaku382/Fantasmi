Dear someone...
I don't actually know
who I'm writing to.
Or why I'm doing it.
Maybe it's just a way to liberate
a feeling I've been having.
To let out the thoughts
that come from specific events.
Or maybe it's to pass
these stories on to someone...
So that they'll be remembered.
You can call me Miss A,
anyway.
My full name
is not important at all.
It wouldn't add anything to this story.
Because what I'm going to tell you
is more about others than about me.
So...
I'll start from the beginning.
I was taking a walk the other day.
While finding myself in the vastness
of nature around my house...
I lost track of time.
And when I got back,
a letter was waiting for me.
The only thing on the envelope was my address.
The sender's name
was missing...
But I immediately
recognized the writing.
And when I opened it,
a rush of memories hit me.
Shinya...
I hadn't heard from him for so long,
and yet I never forgot him.
As I read those words,
old feelings peeled through my mind.
Silently.
Our ghosts...
Months had passed
since the last time I saw one.
But I still remember it
very clearly.
An Autumn afternoon,
after a rainy morning.
Right when it stopped pouring down,
someone entered in the bar.
I was alone,
expecting for clients.
Or visitors,
just like him.
I've been keeping this coffee bar for some years, now.
And it has always been
quiet and calm.
Tender light peeking in
through the windows.
Soft wind caressing
the curtains.
Atmospheric music flowing
from hidden speakers.
Then, right in the middle
of that afternoon, he came in.
Like many others,
he came for me.
For my ability.
And I, in a way,
was waiting for him...
Or for someone like him.
He rapidly looked around...
And then he took a seat next to me,
gazing at the floor with nostalgic eyes.
I think he wanted to say something,
but somehow he couldn't.
Hi, welcome to my coffee bar!
...
Hey.
Kenny.
It's a nice one!
You can call me Miss A.
Nice to meet you, Kenny.
Oh...
n-nice to meet you too.
Yeah, I'm...
I'm not from around here.
Actually, I live very far.
Had to took an airplane
to come here...
Oh really...?
Well, that seems like
a big effort for real....
You can bet on that.
I...
I think you know...
And what is it
I should know?
The reason...
My reason to be here.
I mean...
You're that Miss A., right?
Yes.
Miss A. in the flesh.
I bet you wanna talk
about your ghost,right?
Yes...
I'm having...
Very big troubles with it.
I think.
You think?
I'm not entirely sure.
I feel like something is off.
With me, in general.
My mood hasn't been the same since...
long time.
It's like something
isn't working properly, in me.
I tried asking for advices,
and for help, but...
I got nothing.
And then, a dear friend
told me about you.
He said that personal ghosts
can influence one's life.
That this is the issue I'm having.
The source of my feelings.
So I decided to...try.
And I came here.
Yes, that's true.
Lots of people
come here seeking for help...
And bring their ghosts with them,
hoping that I will be able to erase them.
That I'll make them disappear.
But please,
don't expect solutions.
I can't solve your problems.
I can only identify them.
That's ok.
All I want is
to know what's wrong.
Ok, let's see, then...
Do I...
Do I have to do
something particular?
No.
Just turn towards me.
Look into my eye.
And tell me about
yourself.
Throughout the years I got accostumed
to more and more fear...
At each step I took...
At each eye I met...
I always felt an uncomfortable feeling.
As if I was cursed.
Fully aware of my obligations...
Of my duties as an artist
towards my fans.
I did everything I could
for everyone.
And yet nobody
did anything for me.
That's when fear appeared.
When I started
feeling unwell.
In that moment,
I looked around myself...
Stop talking!
Don't tell her anything!
It took you long enough
to show up.
There's so many
of you in one!
Are you...
a conglomerate...?
It's none
of your business.
Leave us alone.
We don't need you.
We don't care.
He's in good company
with us.
He does not need
anyone's help.
We are the only ones
who can help him.
We won't.
Now let us leave
this place.
They are so stubborn...
Maybe I should be firmer.
Once again, that's none
of your business.
He's weak.
He commits mistakes.
We are here to solve them.
What do you know
about us?
We are strangers.
We don't know you.
You don't know us.
So your opinion does not matter.
They sound harsher then before...
Yes.
We are.
Now let us leave,
please.
Are they wavering?
You are all talk
and no act.
You stand there,
with your mighty words.
While he keeps on suffering.
And you don't even
let him talk.
Are you helping him
for real?
It does not seem so.
...
We won't talk anymore,
then.
Absolutely not.
You only are
a useless brat.
We are more
than enough for him.
No one ever helped him.
And you're not an ecception.
...
What are you insinuating?
Oh absolutely nothing...
Just that you are
such a good ghost...
And I bet
it's also your fault...
Right?
...
...
We are tired
of your pathetic nonsense.
You think
you can scare us?
Make us angry?
You can't.
Exceptions don't exist.
Humans are all the same.
They demand,
but don't give.
They lie,
and are never sincere.
Not even
with themselves.
Such is
the human condition.
Your words
don't touch us.
We don't care about what
you have to say.
And we will never do.
Aren't you just as selfish,
by doing that?
Ghosts should be
better than humans, right?
...
Then,
the ghost stopped talking.
And Kenny looked
way more sad than before.
He still stood there
for a while.
In silence.
And then, he got away.
As if he was
controlled by something.
Something stronger...
That forced him to go away
and never come back.
That wasn't
my first or only failure.
It happens a lot...
To fail
at talking with a ghost.
Personal ghosts can be stubborn.
Or aggressive.
Or introvert.
Sometimes it's dangerous
to even engage with them.
And yet, that day left me
a sense of defeat.
But Shinya's letter
still continued...
And the other two parts
reminded me of two other encounters.
...
Ok, then.
We will let him talk.
For this time.
Don't worry,
there won't be others.
Kenny?
Are you there?
Y-yes...
What was I
saying...?
You were talking
about your fear.
Yeah,
right...
At that time...
Even though I had people
all around me...
I felt lonely.
No one was really
interested in me.
They were much rather
into my fame.
They feeded themselves
off it.
They feeded off me.
And then I escaped.
I erased
my phone number.
Fled from
my country.
And came here...
to understand myself.
But I still feel
all those eyes on me.
My...
My creations.
All the things
I wrote.
All the things
I thought...
I thought that
throwing them outside of me would help.
I wanted to...
I don't know...
Maybe to liberate myself.
Or to send messages
to other people.
But sometimes people
just want to take.
And take...
And take again.
Then the pressure comes in.
You can't create anymore.
Expectations arise.
Time runs shorter.
And you can't help but
fall victim of all this.
I tried doing my best...
But I don't know
if I succeeded.
I want to find myself
once again.
I feel like I've lost...me.
And I have to find all my pieces.
And I thought
that...
Putting some distance between
present and past can help, sometimes.
And new places
can give new ideas.
New images
can inspire new feelings.
Fame is an obstacle to that.
An obstacle to the process...
And also to the result.
It poisons the creation
from the moment it starts developing...
Until the second it is born.
You know...
Your ghost was very stubborn.
And harsh.
And it was more than one.
I call that kind 'conglomerate'.
Which means it is a multitude of ghosts
that form one entity.
So, more personal ghosts into one.
And they wanted to protect you
from the outside world.
Sometimes, ghosts think
they act in our defense, but...
They act as a reflection
of our self-defense mechanism.
Taking distance from people...
Abandoning our past...
Embracing the future...
All these actions may be guided
by you or your ghost.
So, let me ask you something...
You don't have to answer,
but let's try anyway.
...
Maybe.
I would like to.
There is peace in travelling.
And freedom.
And when I'm writing, now,
it's not for others...
But for myself alone.
Somehow, though...
I'll have to think about it.
Sometimes I think I should...
Going back,
solving everything I left behind...
There are nights in which
I dream about all that.
The people
I abandoned.
The situations
I escaped from.
And I ask
myself...
What's happening there, now?
Is there someone
waiting for me?
But I don't know if I could.
Not even if I should.
Like I said
at the beginning...
I can't give you
any answer.
I can only ask questions.
Talk with your ghost.
Pass through its defenses...
And open your mind.
Then, encourage you to look at things
from different perspectives.
I think that's enough.
It really helped.
And I can truly tell you that...
Coming here all the way from home
was worth it.
So...
thank you.
Oh, you don't have to
thank me!
Don't worry about it.
It's my hobby.
Your hobby?
Yes...
My job is to keep this place.
And talking with ghosts
is just something I do to help others.
I think it's the least
I can do for other people.
I still remember that day with melancholy.
A slightly happier one
than Kenny's, though.
Anyway...
He took a coffee.
We drank together for a bit.
Talked about our lives.
About his writings.
About the travel
and the sensations that come with it.
I remember feeling envious.
I, too, wanted to go far away.
To discover new things.
But I'm still
tied to this place.
Before going away,
he said this...
If he had my power,
he would have used it to know people better...
To analyze the world around him.
In order to write about it
and let other people know.
And I can't help
but wonder...
Is this what you are doing now,
Shinya?
Your letter
still continued...
And the remaining two parts
reminded me of two other encounters.
What's your name?
I've never seen you around these parts...
What brings you here?
I just want to help him.
Let me try, at least!
Why is he here, if you are enough?
Won't you just give me one opportunity?
You're not doing a good job, then.
Are you so much helpful?
Ghosts like you are just a front.
What if I don't?
Oh, and are you? Really?
Maybe I am.
So good that he's suffering so much.
Aren't you?
I'm not the unsincere one, here.
Yet you demand attention, but don't give any.
What is it that made you famous?
How can travelling help you?
Will you continue travelling?
Will you go back?
